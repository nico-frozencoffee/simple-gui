# Simple GUI

A simple GUI for SDL, written in C

This is a simple GUI library and application for SDL2 written in C. This project is meant to be used as a fun
project to expand skills and learn how best to implement graphical user interfaces in native applications. This library
is meant to cross platform compatible with at least Windows and macOs, however all development of this has taken place
on macOs so there is a chance that something might not work quite right on Windows.

## Get Started

```shell
mkdir Release && cd ./Release && cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Release
```
